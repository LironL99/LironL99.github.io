## Featured Projects

### 1. Ultrasonic Sensor Servo Control Project 📡
Using **Arduino**, this project creates a distance measurement system using an **ultrasonic sensor** and a **servo motor**. It provides visual feedback through red LEDs based on measured distance. A radar-like display in Processing represents distance readings in real-time, allowing users to adjust the **scanning speed** with a **potentiometer**. This project enhanced my skills in **wiring**, **component integration**, **debugging**, and programming in the **Arduino IDE** using **C++**.

### 2. 4-bit ALU 🧮
This project implements a 4-bit Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) using **Verilog**. The ALU performs essential operations like addition, subtraction, and logical operations, serving as a foundational digital design component.

### 3. Integrated Circuits and Introduction to VLSI Tasks 🛠️
This repository includes two significant tasks focusing on VLSI design and verification using **Cadence Virtuoso**. These projects involve:
- MOSFET, Inverter & Buffer Design – Optimizing and designing fundamental digital components.
- Digital Logic Blocks – Designing and testing adders, multiplexer, and barrel shifter.

The tasks emphasize low-power design, timing optimization, and parasitic extraction, utilizing Cadence Virtuoso for simulation and verification.
