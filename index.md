## Featured Projects

### 1. RISC Pipeline CPU (Verilog) üß†
Built a **modular 5-stage pipelined RISC CPU** in **Verilog**, with separated instruction/data memory, register file, and a combinational ALU.  
The project progressed from a single-cycle CPU to a pipelined architecture with IF, ID, EX, MEM, and WB stages, each separated by pipeline registers.  
Features support for **R/I/S/B/J instruction formats**, a **5-bit opcode** system, and a custom **ROM test program** verified in **ModelSim**.  
Current work includes **forwarding logic**, **hazard detection**, and a clean separation of control vs. data paths.

### 2. Automated Log Analysis & Alerting System üõ†Ô∏è  
Developed a **Python-based** tool for **automated log parsing**, **anomaly detection**, and **real-time email alerts**, reducing debugging time by **90%** and generating structured **PDF/HTML reports** with visual insights for **verification engineers**. This system improves **failure detection efficiency**, ensures **consistent error reporting**, and **automates alert notifications**.

### 4. Ultrasonic Sensor Servo Control Project üì°  
This project creates a **distance measurement system** using an **ultrasonic sensor** and a **servo motor**, providing visual feedback through **red LEDs** based on the measured distance. The system features a **radar-like display** using **Processing**, which visually represents distance readings in real time and allows users to adjust the **scanning speed** via a **potentiometer**. The project enhanced my skills in **wiring**, **integrating components**, **debugging**, and programming within the **Arduino IDE (C++)**.
