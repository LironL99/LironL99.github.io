## Featured Projects

### 1. RISC-V Single Cycle CPU (Verilog) üß†  
Designed and implemented a **Single-Cycle CPU** in **Verilog** that supports basic **RISC-V** instructions (R, I, S, B types) including arithmetic, logical, load/store, and branches.  
The CPU features:
- A modular design with **Register File**, **ALU**, **Control Units**, and **Instruction/Data Memory**
- Full **waveform simulation in ModelSim** with a real instruction program
- Detailed **README** including explanations, tables, diagrams, and insights

The project emphasizes educational clarity and ISA understanding, serving as a stepping stone for pipelined architectures.

### 2. Automated Log Analysis & Alerting System üõ†Ô∏è  
Developed a **Python-based** tool for **automated log parsing**, **anomaly detection**, and **real-time email alerts**, reducing debugging time by **90%** and generating structured **PDF/HTML reports** with visual insights for **verification engineers**.
